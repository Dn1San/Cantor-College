            <p>The College is an internationally connected creative community of diverse 
                disciplines housed under one roof. We shape our students' futures, preparing 
                them to shape the world through applied knowledge and creativity.
            </p>
            <p>The College's art and design courses don't just train you, they promote 
                alternative ways of thinking, making and communicating; they provide you 
                with space, tools and inspiration to develop your creative practice and a 
                clear career path. You'll get expert teaching from active practitioners and 
                researchers who will encourage you to adopt innovative and resourceful 
                approaches that both perceive and create opportunities for better lives.
            </p>
            <p>Youâ€™ll develop your creative practice whilst interacting with your peers in 
                well-equipped studios, making and digital workshops. At the same time, you'll 
                learn professional skills by working on applied briefs facilitated through our 
                links with commercial clients, cultural institutions, businesses and organisations.
